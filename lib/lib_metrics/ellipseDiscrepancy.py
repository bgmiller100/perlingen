# This function calculates a measure of discrepancy between a set of
# metrics associated with a pattern, and the metrics associated with a
# target pattern. The latter is distinguished because the eccentricity of
# the ellipses in the target pattern is used to further weight the
# distances calculated for angles. If the optional third argument is
# provided, the distance is the Mahalanobis distance, otherwise it is
# Euclidean (except with the period nature of angles taken into account).
#
# INPUTS:
#
# metrics:         a row vector (or matrix) of metrics for a single 
#                  (multiple) pattern(s)
# target_metrics:  the metrics for the target pattern
# (invC):          inverse covariance matrix for Mahalanobis distance
#
# OUTPUT:
#
# D:               discrepancies for each pattern
