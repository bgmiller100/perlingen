This function performs SMC-ABC as laid out by:
Drovandi, C. C. and Pettitt, A. N. (2011). Estimation of Parameters for
Macroparasite Population Evolution using Approximate Bayesian Computation.
Biometrics, 67(1):225-233.

Sets of particles satisfying a set of intermediary "discrepancy cutoffs"
are generated by successive resampling and mutation steps in the vein of
traditional SMC. The function is designed to be modular, so accepts as
input the functions that will be used to simulate the model, and to
calculate the discrepancy with the target data. Further options may be
specified by the user within the body of the program.

Usage:   [part_thetas, part_vals] = performSMCABC(N_parts, f_simulate, f_summaries, f_discrep, target_data, params_mins, params_maxs, scale_param, desired_D, visualise, (f_visualise), (options) )

INPUTS
-------
N_parts - The number of particles to generate. Corresponds to the
          expected number of outputs satisfying the discrepancy criteria
          at the end of the method

f_simulate - The function used to simulate the model. This should
             generate only one output (but a struct could be used to
             store varied information/multiple outputs). The input is a
             single vector of parameters

f_summaries - The function used to calculate the summary statistics for
              given data. Takes as input a single object, which is the
              output of f_simulate. The target data should also be
              specified in this format

f_discrepancy - The function used to calculate the discrepancy between
                two sets of metrics. As a basis this would be the
               Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance, but is supplied
                separately so that extra problem-specific modifications
                can be made (e.g. taking into account periodicity of
                angular measures)

target_data - The data, of equivalent type to that generated by
              f_simulate, that the SMC_ABC routine seeks to generate
             samples sufficiently close to

params_mins - The minimum values allowed for the parameters of the model

params_maxs - The maximum values allowed for the parameters of the model

scale_param - Vector of logicals of length equal to number of parameters.
              Specifies which parameters are 'scale' parameters that are
              to be transformed logarithmically so as to have a uniform
              prior.

desired_D - The discrepancy that the algorithm will attempt to achieve
            (typical D values depend on application, so this is
            externally specified by the user)

NOT IMPLEMENTED:
    visualise - A boolean flag specifying if the user wants to visualise the
                output during the course of the algorithm

    (f_visualise) - A function (supplied by user because likely
                    application-specific) that visualises the results.
                    Optional argument, only used if visualise flag is set.
                    Syntax must be
                    visFunc( params, outputs, summaries, discrepancies )

    (options) - A struct containing modifications to the SMC-ABC algorithm's
                default options/parameters. Information regarding these is
                contained within the file. User may set:

                options.resample_weighting ('equal', 'weighted')
                options.metric_weighting ('mahalanobis', 'variance', 'none')
                options.keep_fraction ([0,1])
                options.max_MCMC_steps (positive integer)
                options.verbose (0 - false, 1 - true)

                For optional outputs, (options) must come last (but can be supplied after
                'visualise' flag if it is set to zero)

OUTPUTS
--------

part_thetas - The locations in parameter space of the final particles

part_vals - The model outputs corresponding to each particle
